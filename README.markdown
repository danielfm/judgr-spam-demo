# Judgr Spam Classification Demo

This is a sample application built on top of
[Judgr](http://danielfm.github.com/judgr/), a naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier
library written in Clojure.

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository and start a REPL by running `lein repl`
in its root directory.

Then, load the core namespace:

````clojure

user=> (use 'judgr-spam-demo.core)
nil
````

### Training The Classifier

This repository comes with a few thousand messages for training and
testing the classifier. See _License_ section below for further
information.

The following command will train the classifier using the messages
stored in `data/training`:

````clojure

user=> (time (train!))
"Elapsed time: 20983.71 msecs"
````

This operation might take several seconds to finish.

### Trying It Out

Choose a few messages from `data/testing` and see if the classifier
got them right:

````clojure

user=> (.classify classifier (slurp "data/testing/TEST_XXXXX.eml"))
:spam
````
